dump sequence
==============

- Read contents of RAM
- Apply offset/gains
    - Specific per channel and analog gain
    - In EEPROM

- capture gain locally in flops on write

Hoff has states in cmd for DUMP and RD_OFFSET

Reading EEPROM for dump
=======================

Need three transactions
    1. Send: RD_OFF  Read: Junk
    2. Send: RD_GAIN Read: offset
    3. Send: JUNK    Read: gain

Then read SRAM, send to UART...

Notes
-----

* trig_en = trig_cfg[3] || trig_cfg[2]
* Only pay attention to triggered in normal mode
* Decimator looks like decoder
* Grading area 2355
